# MMT
A Matlab library for multi-task learning, implements lasso, multi-task lasso, and graph-guided lasso.

## Features
- An effcient and well calibrated (in terms of algorithm, time, and memory) C implementation with Matlab binding
- Supports multi-threads with openMPI
- Well tested with both simulated and real datasets
- Support large data size up to the order of 10k+ features and 10k+ tasks
